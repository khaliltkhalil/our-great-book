# Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Yeah, lots of people did. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Bender?! You stole the atom. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

I wish! It's a nickel. How much did you make me? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I never loved you. And I'd do it again! **And perhaps a third time!** _But that would be it._ And why did 'I' have to take a cab?

## Is the Space Pope reptilian!?

Why would I want to know that? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

1. Moving along…
2. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
3. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

### You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. It must be wonderful. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Can we have Bender Burgers again?

- I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.
- Then we'll go with that data file!
- Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

Why would a robot need to drink? Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

File not found. I'm a thing. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. You mean while I'm sleeping in it?

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. But I've never been to the moon!

Why would a robot need to drink? And then the battle's not so bad? No, just a regular mistake. Bite my shiny metal ass. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Ow, my spirit! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Belligerent and numerous.

But existing is basically all I do! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

Kids have names? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. I'm Santa Claus! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?

Ummm…to eBay? I'll get my kit! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
